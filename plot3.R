## The goal of this script is to create a plot using UCI household energy usage
## data. The data pertaining to the relevant dates is read into a data frame,
## adjustments are made to the data, and then a histogram of the global active
## power is created and saved to a PNG file. To read the files, an approximate
## 8.8 megabytes of memory are required.

# The first line of the data is read to extract the column names to label the
# final data frame.
