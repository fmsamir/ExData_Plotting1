## The goal of this script is to create a plot using UCI household energy usage
## data. The data pertaining to the relevant dates is read into a data frame,
## adjustments are made to the data, and then a histogram of the global active
## power is created and saved to a PNG file. To read the files, an approximate
## 8.8 megabytes of memory are required.

# The first line of the data is read to extract the column names to label the
# final data frame.

# the dates February 1, 2007 and February 2, 2007.

# time columns are combined and converted to a POSIXlt time class for future
# ease of plotting. Missing values (?) are also identified.

# A PNG file is created with the required dimensions containing four plots.

# global active power, with a line type and label for y-axis specified. The
# second plot is of voltage, with a line type specified. The third plot is of 
# the three sub meterings. A line type and a label for the y-axis is specified,
# along with colors for each of the three sub meterings and a supporting
# legend. The fourth plot is of global reactive power, with a line type
# specified.
